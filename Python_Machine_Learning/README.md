## Machine learning method by python

1. Record your data from MQSim
2. Do Data processing, and you can see [here](https://github.com/hcsh1112/Supervised_Learning_on_GC_in_MQSim/blob/master/Python_Machine_Learning/training_data_processing.ipynb)
3. You can choose different machine learning models to classify GC/NonGC
  * [Random Forest(Recommend)](https://github.com/hcsh1112/Supervised_Learning_on_GC_in_MQSim/blob/master/Python_Machine_Learning/Random_Forest_based.ipynb)
  * [Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/hcsh1112/Supervised_Learning_on_GC_in_MQSim/blob/master/Python_Machine_Learning/SVM_based.ipynb)
  * [Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/hcsh1112/Supervised_Learning_on_GC_in_MQSim/blob/master/Python_Machine_Learning/DNN_based.ipynb)
  * Simple test in different methods( Using Systor17 trace and 9:1 training/testing data )
  
4. Must SAVE your model to be a files, in order to use it in MQSim.
